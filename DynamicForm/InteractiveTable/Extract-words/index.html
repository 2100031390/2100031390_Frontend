    <p id="text-paragraph">The ancient castle stood atop the rugged cliff, its imposing silhouette casting a long shadow over the surrounding landscape. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the castle's battlements were bathed in a golden hue, giving the centuries-old structure an ethereal glow. Within its walls, tales of valor and betrayal echoed through the corridors, whispered by the ghosts of the past. But amidst the echoes of history, a single word stood out, its significance etched into the stone walls: 'Destiny.' With more than eight characters, it shimmered against the backdrop of the castle's history, a beacon of hope in a world filled with uncertainty.</p>
